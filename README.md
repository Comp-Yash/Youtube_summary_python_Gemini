Code Overview and Purpose
The provided Python script processes YouTube video content using advanced AI tools and libraries to convert it into summarized text, 
generate questions, and provide related insights. By leveraging technologies like OpenAI Whisper, Google Gemini AI, and Pytube,
the application automates video analysis and provides valuable outputs. Additionally, it uses Streamlit to offer an interactive web-based interface for users.



Key Features and Workflow
1. YouTube Video Analysis:
Extracts video transcripts directly from YouTube captions or converts audio to text using the OpenAI Whisper model.
2. Summarization:
Generates both concise (100 words) and detailed (500 words) summaries of YouTube videos using Google Gemini AI.
3. Question Generation:
Produces 10 topic-related questions based on the video content and reference links, fostering deeper exploration.
4. Content Rating:
Rates the video on a scale of 1 to 10 and provides a brief explanation for the score.
5. Related Links:
Suggests a list of five related YouTube video links based on the analyzed content.
6. Streamlit UI Integration:
Offers a user-friendly interface where users can input YouTube links and view results like summaries, questions, ratings, and related links.


High-End Machine:
The application uses heavy models such as OpenAI Whisper (voice-to-text) and Gemini AI, requiring significant computational resources (CPU/GPU and memory).
Recommendation:
Run the script on Google Colab or a similar environment with GPU/TPU support to handle processing efficiently.


Libraries and APIs Used
Pytube and yt-dlp: For downloading video/audio content.
Whisper: For converting audio to text.
Google Generative AI: For generating summaries, questions, and ratings.
Streamlit: For building an interactive user interface.
YouTubeTranscriptAPI: For fetching YouTube captions when available.


Notes for Users

Configuration: Ensure all required libraries (pytube, yt_dlp, streamlit, whisper, etc.) are installed.
API Keys: Replace placeholders like "AIzaSyC6n5DmiCyF3bSmfRZf24qv4CuNswexopk" with your valid API key for Google Generative AI.
Execution: Use the command streamlit run script_name.py to launch the app in a browser-friendly UI.
This tool provides a robust platform for summarizing and analyzing YouTube videos. Its future enhancements, such as personalized recommendations and predictive analytics,
aim to make it a comprehensive solution for video content analysis and exploration.
